This is an overview of my studying sources for the [AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional Exam](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional/).

For background, I have obtained the three associate level AWS certifications, architect, sysops and developer. This is my first professional exam.

I have 5 years experience working with various AWS services. But most of that has dealt with web hosting and other serverless application development practices. Some other services used for data warehousing/BI topics I am not as well versed in and will need to review them more thoroughly.

## Overview of required knowledge

Much of this is based off of AWS's exam guide and material from https://aws.training. My goal will be to become as knowledgable as possible on the five domain's the exam covers:

1. Design for Organizational Complexity (12.5%)
1. Design for New Solutions (31%)
1. Migration Planning (15%)
1. Cost Control (12.5)
1. Continous Improvement for Existing Solutions (29%)

### Next steps

As I go through the initial materials described above I will create blog posts outlining the various videos/whitepapers I have read for studying and link them here.
