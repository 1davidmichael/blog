As [previously described](https://blog.dmichael.be/2020/09/28/study-guide-for-aws-architect-pro-exam/) I have taken the [AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Professional exam](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional/) and passed.

I primarily studied via a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-solutions-architect-professional/) available through my employer, AWS white papers, and Re:Invent videos available on Youtube.com

My notes, which were primarily taken for myself can be found here: <https://github.com/1davidmichael/AWS-Certified-Solutions-Architect-Professional-Exam-Study-Notes>

These notes should not be substituted for your own learning and real-world experience but may provide an overview of skills and background knowledge that is needed.
