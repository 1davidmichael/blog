This blog's infrastructure is deployed to AWS via the [CDK]. It is automatically created and deployed via [GitHub Actions]. I hope to provide more details on
how this was done at a later date.

The content of the blog is written in Markdown and generated into HTML by
the static site generator [Hexo].
