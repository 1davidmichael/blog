# The Terraform Ecosystem

I've started a new position and with that comes new tools and new responsibilities. One new tool I am using more than ever is [Terraform], which I have a new appreciation for. Not because of the tool itself, terraform is a pretty basic IaC tool. But instead I've really enjoyed the ecosystem that has developed in the past few years around it. I'd used terraform in the 2017-2018 time frame but the open source culture has embraced it and created a lot of nice tools for it. I'll outline some of them here.
