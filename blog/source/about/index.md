# Who Am I?

I am David Michael, a Senior Platform Engineer located in Des Moines, IA. I primarily work within AWS but occasionally deal with other cloud providers. I am using this blog as a way to get familiar with the [CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) and provide an easy way for me to publish my persona; and work experiences via a GitHub Actions pipeline.

This blog is written using the [hexo](https://hexo.io/) static blog platform, hosted on AWS via CloudFront and S3.

I am an open source advocate and enjoy using open source software to build all manner of thingss.

## Experience

I spent 10 years working at my previous job doing various System and Cloud Administrator tasks. I also led a team in migrating complex web hosting services to AWS. I have multiple AWS certs, including the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Pro.

I've since moved on to a new role at an insurance provider and am working on fostering a DevOps culture and providing useful services for other development teams.

If you'd like to get in contact with me see my personal contact info on the home page.

## What Else

I am enjoy spending time with my family, being outside, cycling and drinking beer.
