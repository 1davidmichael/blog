# Who Am I?

I am David Michael, a Sr DevOps Engineer located in Des Moines, IA. I primarily work within AWS but occasionally deal with other cloud providers. I am using this blog as a way to get familiar with the CDK and provide an easy way for me to publish my experiences via a GitHub Actions pipeline.

## Experience

I spent 10 years working at my previous job doing various System and Cloud Administrator tasks. I also led a team in migrating services to AWS.

I've since moved on to a new role at an insurance provider and am working on fosting a DevOps community and providing useful services for other development teams. 

If you'd like to get in contact with me see my personal contact info on the home page.

## What Else

I am enjoy spending time with my family, being outside, cycling and drinking beer.
